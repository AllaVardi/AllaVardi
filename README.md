## Hi, I’m Alla 👋

I work at the intersection of **cybersecurity, risk analysis, and security operations**, with a strong focus on security fundamentals and responsible security practices.

My background combines professional experience in cybersecurity recruitment with hands-on technical training and applied security projects, with an emphasis on ethical, defensive, and risk-based security work.

**Current focus:** security operations fundamentals, external attack surface analysis, vulnerability assessment and CVSS-based prioritization, and cloud security fundamentals (AWS).

**Certifications:** CompTIA Security+, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Offensive Security Web Assessor (OSWA) — in progress.

**Featured project:**  
External Penetration Testing Capstone (Sanitized)

I value clear documentation and translating technical findings into actionable security insights.
